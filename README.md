## 🎯 Project Goal

The main goal of this project was to develop a **single-page** application that simulates the behavior of an interactive counter. The app allows users to **increase** and **decrease** a numerical value through dedicated buttons, with an initial value of `0`.

The core of the development was **DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation** (without using libraries or frameworks like jQuery, React, Angular, or Vue) and the logical implementation in **pure JavaScript**.

## ✨ Features Implemented

* **Interactive Counter:** Increase or decrease the counter value with a simple click.
* **Reset Functionality:** A dedicated button to quickly reset the counter to its initial value of `0`.
* **Dynamic Interface:** All interface elements (value display, buttons) are created and managed dynamically via JavaScript.
* **Simple and Intuitive Design:** A clean and user-friendly interface.
* **Modern Style:** A modern visual touch (or at least I tried) thanks to CSS.
